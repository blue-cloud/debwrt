	help
	  Build MIPS Floating Point emultaion into the kernel. Actually OpenWrt created a patch
	  to remove FPU code for MIPS from the kernel, to save a few bytes. However, Debian needs
	  the FPU to be enabled since glibc? does not have FPU code compiled in. When FPU is not
	  available no Debian compiled program will run. Init(which is the first process which is

          Say Y here to enable inotify support.  Inotify is a file change
          notification system and a replacement for dnotify.  Inotify fixes
          numerous shortcomings in dnotify and introduces several new features
          including multiple file events, one-shot support, and unmount
          notification.

      This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
      interrupt. This add-on card is a bootable PCI UDMA controller. Since
      multiple cards can be installed and there are BIOS ROM problems that
      happen if the BIOS revisions of all installed cards (three-max) do
      not match, the driver attempts to do dynamic tuning of the chipset
      at boot-time for max-speed.  Ultra33 BIOS 1.25 or newer is required
      for more than one card.

          which lists the devices currently connected to your USB bus or

          "/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy", where xxx is the bus number and yyy the
          device number; the latter files can be used by user space programs
          to talk directly to the device. These files are "virtual", meaning
          they are generated on the fly and not stored on the hard drive.

          You may need to mount the usbfs file system to see the files, use
          mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb

          For the format of the various /proc/bus/usb/ files, please read
          <file:Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt>.

          Usbfs files can't handle Access Control Lists (ACL), which are the
          default way to grant access to USB devices for untrusted users of a
          desktop system. The usbfs functionality is replaced by real
          device-nodes managed by udev. These nodes live in /dev/bus/usb and

          Userspace access to USB devices is granted by device-nodes exported
          directly from the usbdev in sysfs. Old versions of the driver
          core and udev needed additional class devices to export device nodes.

          These additional devices are difficult to handle in userspace, if
          information about USB interfaces must be available. One device
          contains the device node, the other device contains the interface
          data. Both devices are at the same level in sysfs (siblings) and one
          can't access the other. The device node created directly by the
          usb device is the parent device of the interface and therefore
          easily accessible from the interface event.

          This option provides backward compatibility for libusb device
          nodes (lsusb) when usbfs is not used, and the following udev rule
          doesn't exist:

          If your USB host controller supports USB 2.0, you will likely want to

          EHCI controllers are packaged with "companion" host controllers (OHCI

          will connect to EHCI if the device is high speed, otherwise they
          connect to a companion controller.  If you configure EHCI, you should
          probably configure the OHCI (for NEC and some other vendors) USB Host
          Controller Driver or UHCI (for Via motherboards) Host Controller
          Driver too.

      The Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) is a standard for accessing

	help
	  This is the journalling version of the Second extended file system
	  (often called ext3), the de facto standard Linux file system
	  (method to organize files on a storage device) for hard disks.

	  The journalling code included in this driver means you do not have
	  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
	  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
	  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
	  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

	  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
	  of ext3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
	  between using the ext3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
	  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
	  system.

	  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
	  behavior of ext3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
	  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on ext3
	  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using
	  e2fsprogs version 1.20 or later in order to create ext3 journals
	  (available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/e2fsprogs/>).

	  If a filesystem does not explicitly specify a data ordering

	  That was a rather unfortunate choice, because it leads to all

	  appropriate these days.

	  You should probably always answer 'n' here, and if you really
	  want to use 'data=ordered' mode, set it in the filesystem itself
